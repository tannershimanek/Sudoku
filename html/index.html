    <h2>Project Description</h2>
    <p>This game will dynamically create a sudoku puzzle based off of the selected difficulty. The player will first select a difficulty out of the 3 options of Easy, Medium, or Hard. After the player selects the difficulty the player will be notified with a start button. Once the player clicks the button, the game timer will start, a new puzzle board will be generated. The given numbers will be emphasized with a blue color and the inputs will be blank. Once the game has been started the player can click a new difficulty and the "new game" button at anytime to reset the timer and generate a new puzzle grid.</p>

    <p>When a player types an input, the game will prevent any non integer characters from being typed. If an inputted integer passes all the checks following the Sudoku game rules, then the input will be seen as valid and the cell will change to a green background. However, if the input does not pass the checks, the input will be seen as invalid and change the input background to pink as well as the cell within the row or column with the same number to red.</p>

    <p>Once the puzzle has been solved and the game has been completed, the "gameOver" state will change to True and the puzzle grid will be locked. Finally, the player will be notified with a congratulations message displaying their time to complete and a final prompt to play again. If the player decides to play again, the message will go away.</p>

    <p>Traditionally Sudoku is a 9x9 puzzle grid that is split into nine 3x3 grids. Each region, row, and column cointains nine cells each. Throughout the 9x9 grid there are given numbers that cannot be changed. To solve the puzzle every row and column must contain the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 without any duplicates. In other words, there may not be any rows or columns that are identical. On top of the previous rules, each 3x3 region must also contain the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. Duplicated numbers are not allowed in any region, and no other regions will be identical. Press the start button to start the timer and finishe the puzzle as fast as you can.</p>
